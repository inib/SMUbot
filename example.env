# Example environment configuration for the Songbot stack.
# Copy this file to 'stack.env' and adjust the values before starting
# the services.

# Shared secret for privileged backend endpoints
ADMIN_TOKEN=change-me

# HTTP basic auth credentials for the Admin panel
ADMIN_BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=admin
ADMIN_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=change-me

# URL reachable by the bot to access the backend API
BACKEND_URL=http://api:7070

# Optional canonical origin exposed to browser clients. Set this to the
# externally reachable API origin (e.g. https://api.example.com) so the static
# frontends can call the backend without guessing from window.location.
# Leave empty to fall back to the automatic heuristics used today.
PUBLIC_BACKEND_ORIGIN=

# Optional comma separated list of allowed origins for browser clients.
# Wildcards using `*` are supported (e.g. https://*.example.com).
# If left empty, any http(s) origin will be allowed.
# CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=
# Optional regular expression for matching allowed origins when the list is empty.
# Defaults to allowing any http(s) origin, which supports the admin frontend
# while remaining compatible with bot requests that do not rely on cookies.
# CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN_REGEX=https?://.*

# All Twitch OAuth credentials, bot scopes, and overlay settings are now
# configured through the admin panel after the stack boots. Only paths and
# secrets remain in this file.

# Port for exposing the web interface (optional)
WEB_PORT=7000

# Optional port overrides for management panels
QUEUE_MANAGER_PORT=7100
