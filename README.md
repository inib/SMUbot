# Songbot

Songbot is a Twitch song request system consisting of a FastAPI backend, a TwitchIO bot, and a small web interface. It lets viewers request and prioritize songs in channel chats.

See the [docs](docs/README.md) for a full project overview and setup instructions. To get started quickly, copy `example.env` to
`stack.env`, adjust the values, then run `docker-compose --env-file stack.env up --build`.
